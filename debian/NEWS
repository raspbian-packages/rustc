rustc (1.20.0+dfsg1-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  Starting from version 1.20.0+dfsg1-1 (i.e. the previous version) the Debian
  packages of rustc no longer fail their build if any tests fail. In other
  words, some tests might have failed when building this and future versions of
  the package. This is due to lack of maintainer time to investigate failures.

  Many previous test failures were reported to upstream and did not receive a
  timely response, suggesting the failures were not important. I was then
  forced to patch out the test to make the build proceed, so several tests were
  being ignored in practise anyway.

  This brings the Debian package in line with the Fedora package which also
  ignores all test failures. (Many other distributions don't run tests at all.)

  If you think that the Debian rustc package is miscompiling your program in a
  way that the upstream distributed compiler doesn't, you may check the test
  failures here:

  https://buildd.debian.org/status/package.php?p=rustc

  If you can identify a relevant test failure as well as the patches needed to
  fix it (either to rustc or LLVM), this will speed up the processing of any
  bug reports on the Debian side.

  We will also examine these failures ourselves on a best-effort basis and
  attempt to fix the more serious-looking ones.
