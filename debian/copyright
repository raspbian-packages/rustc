# We prefer to do them in different Debian packages so they can have their own
# version numbers. If upstream merges them "properly" (i.e. unify the version
# numbers) then we can merge the packages in Debian. Note that cargotest here
# does actually belong to rustc, it is an integration test suite for rustc to
# check that certain popular crates continue to compile. It is not the same as
# cargo's own test suite (in its own package) also called cargotest.
# NB: don't exclude rust-installer, it's needed for "install" functionality

 Creative Commons Corporation ("Creative Commons") is not a law firm and
 does not provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of
 Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or

 Using Creative Commons Public Licenses
 .
 Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
 conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
 original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
 and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
 following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
 exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.
 .
      Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
      intended for use by those authorized to give the public
      permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
      copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
      irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
      and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
      Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
      applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
      material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
      material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
      licensed material, or material used under an exception or
      limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:
	 wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors
 .
      Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
      licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
      licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
      the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
      example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
      copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
      licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
      other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
      the licensed material may still be restricted for other
      reasons, including because others have copyright or other
      rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
      such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
      Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
      respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations
      for the public:

 Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License
 .
 By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree
 to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
 Attribution 4.0 International Public License ("Public License"). To the
 extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are
 granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of
 these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in
 consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the
 Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.
 .

      Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material
      and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,
      arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring
      permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the
      Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
      Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,

      synched in timed relation with a moving image.
 .
   b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright
      and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in
      accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.
 .
   c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights
      closely related to copyright including, without limitation,
      performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database
      Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or
      categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights
      specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar
      Rights.
 .
   d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
      absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws
      fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright
      Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international
      agreements.
 .
   e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or
      any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights
      that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.
 .
   f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,
      or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public
      License.
 .
   g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the
      terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to
      all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the
      Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.
 .
   h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
      under this Public License.
 .
   i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or
      process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such
      as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,
      dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material
      available to the public including in ways that members of the
      public may access the material from a place and at a time
      individually chosen by them.
 .
   j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
      resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of
      the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,
      as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially
      equivalent rights anywhere in the world.
 .
   k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
      under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.
 .
 .
 Section 2 -- Scope.
 .
   a. License grant.
 .
	1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
	   the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
	   non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
	   exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
 .
	     a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
		in part; and
 .
	     b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.
 .
	2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
	   Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
	   License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
	   its terms and conditions.
 .
	3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
	   6(a).
 .
	4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
	   Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
	   all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
	   and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
	   Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
	   authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
	   necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
	   technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
	   Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
	   simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
	   (4) never produces Adapted Material.
 .
	5. Downstream recipients.
 .
	     a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
		recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
		receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
		Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
		Public License.
 .
	     b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
		any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
		apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
		Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
		Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
		Material.
 .
	6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
	   may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
	   are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
	   with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
	   the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
	   provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
 .
   b. Other rights.
 .
	1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
	   licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
	   privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
	   the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
	   assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
	   extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
	   Rights, but not otherwise.
 .
	2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
	   Public License.
 .
	3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
	   collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
	   Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
	   under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
	   licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
	   reserves any right to collect such royalties.
 .
 .
 Section 3 -- License Conditions.
 .
 Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
 following conditions.
 .
   a. Attribution.
 .
	1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
	   form), You must:
 .
	     a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
		with the Licensed Material:
 .
		  i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
		     Material and any others designated to receive
		     attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
		     the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
		     designated);
 .
		 ii. a copyright notice;
 .
		iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;
 .
		 iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
		     warranties;
 .
		  v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
		     extent reasonably practicable;
 .
	     b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
		retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
 .
	     c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
		Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
		hyperlink to, this Public License.
 .
	2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
	   reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
	   which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
	   reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
	   hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
	   information.
 .
	3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
	   information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
	   reasonably practicable.

	   License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted

 .
 .
 Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.
 .
 Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
 apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:
 .
   a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
      to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
      portion of the contents of the database;
 .
   b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
      contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
      Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
      Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and
 .
   c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
      all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.
 .
 For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
 replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
 Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.
 .
 .
 Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
 .
   a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
      EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
      AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
      ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
      IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
      WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
      PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
      ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
      KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
      ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
   b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
      TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
      NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
      INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
      COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
      USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
      ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
      DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
      IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
   c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
      above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
      possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
      waiver of all liability.
 .
 .
 Section 6 -- Term and Termination.
 .
   a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
      Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
      this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
      terminate automatically.
 .
   b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
      Section 6(a), it reinstates:
 .
	1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
	   it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
	   violation; or
 .
	2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
 .
      For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
      right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
      of this Public License.
 .
   c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
      Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
      distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
      will not terminate this Public License.
 .
   d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
      License.
 .
 .
 Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.
 .
   a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
      terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
 .
   b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
      Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
      independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.
 .
 .
 Section 8 -- Interpretation.
 .
   a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
      shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
      conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
      be made without permission under this Public License.
 .
   b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
      deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
      minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
      cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
      without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
      conditions.
 .
   c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
      failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
      Licensor.
 .
   d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
      as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
      that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
      processes of any jurisdiction or authority.
