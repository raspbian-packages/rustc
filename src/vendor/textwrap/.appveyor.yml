  # From https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rand/commit/bb78689:
  #
  # At the time this was added AppVeyor was having troubles with checking
  # revocation of SSL certificates of sites like static.rust-lang.org and what
  # we think is crates.io. The libcurl HTTP client by default checks for
  # revocation on Windows and according to a mailing list [1] this can be
  # disabled.
  #
  # The `CARGO_HTTP_CHECK_REVOKE` env var here tells cargo to disable SSL
  # revocation checking on Windows in libcurl. Note, though, that rustup, which
  # we're using to download Rust here, also uses libcurl as the default backend.
  # Unlike Cargo, however, rustup doesn't have a mechanism to disable revocation
  # checking. To get rustup working we set `RUSTUP_USE_HYPER` which forces it to
  # use the Hyper instead of libcurl backend. Both Hyper and libcurl use
  # schannel on Windows but it appears that Hyper configures it slightly
  # differently such that revocation checking isn't turned on by default.
