### FEATURES #################################################################

[features]
default = []

# Use LinkedHashMap rather than BTreeMap as the map type of serde_json::Value.
# This allows data to be read into a Value and written back to a JSON string
# while preserving the order of map keys in the input.
preserve_order = ["linked-hash-map"]

# Use `String` to represent numbers internally, thus allowing the serialization
# and deserialization of numbers of arbitrary size/precision, instead of just
# the primitive integers and floats.
# This feature does not provide provide the ability to do arithmetic on
# arbitrary-precision numbers; this is left to the discretion of the consumer.
