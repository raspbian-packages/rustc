# rustfix

> **HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL â€“ MIGHT EAT YOUR CODE**

The goal of this tool is to read and apply the suggestions made by rustc (and third-party lints, like those offered by [clippy]).

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/killercup/rustfix.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/killercup/rustfix)

## Current state

This tool can

- parse rustc's diagnostics (it calls `cargo` for you and reads its output)
- read a file of diagnostics (one JSON object per line)
- interactively step through the suggestions and ask the user what to do
- apply suggestions (currently whole lines only)

## Installation

Assuming you have a recent Rust nightly and Cargo installed:

```sh
$ cargo install --git https://github.com/killercup/rustfix.git
```

Make sure the binaries installed by Cargo are in your `$PATH`.

## Usage

In your project directory, just execute `rustfix`!

You probably want to use `rustfix --clippy` to get all the suggestions from [Clippy][clippy] as well. Make sure you have `cargo clippy` installed (`cargo install clippy`).

Please note that running `rustfix` multiple times in a project where no file was changed in the meantime will currently not generate any suggestions (as Cargo/Rust will skip the unchanged code and not compile it again).

### CLI Options

```plain
rustfix 0.1.0
Automatically apply suggestions made by rustc

USAGE:
    rustfix [FLAGS] [OPTIONS]

FLAGS:
        --clippy     Use `cargo clippy` for suggestions
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:
        --from-file <FILE>    Read suggestions from file (each line is a JSON object)
```

## Get the example running

My current example output for diagnostics is based on [libui-rs](https://github.com/pcwalton/libui-rs). You can find the example JSON in `tests/fixtures/libui-rs/clippy.json`.

Run `rustfix`:

```sh
$ cargo test
```

### Generate the example diagnostics JSON yourself

```sh
$ APPLY_RUSTFIX=1 cargo test
```

## Gotchas

- rustc JSON output is unstable
- Not all suggestions can be applied trivially (e.g. clippy's "You should use `Default` instead of that `fn new()` you just wrote"-lint will replace your `new`-method with an `impl` block -- which is obviously invalid syntax.)
- This tool _will_ eat your laundry
