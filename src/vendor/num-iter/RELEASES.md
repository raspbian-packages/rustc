# Release 0.1.35

- [num-iter now has its own source repository][num-356] at [rust-num/num-iter][home].
- [There is now a `std` feature][2], enabled by default, along with the implication
  that building *without* this feature makes this a `#[no_std]` crate.
  - There is no difference in the API at this time.
