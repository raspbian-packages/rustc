///
/// **Why is this bad?** Calling `drop` on a reference will only drop the
/// reference itself, which is a no-op. It will not call the `drop` method (from
/// the `Drop` trait implementation) on the underlying referenced value, which
/// is likely what was intended.
///
/// **Known problems:** None.
///
/// **Example:**
/// ```rust
/// let mut lock_guard = mutex.lock();
/// std::mem::drop(&lock_guard) // Should have been drop(lock_guard), mutex
/// still locked
/// operation_that_requires_mutex_to_be_unlocked();
