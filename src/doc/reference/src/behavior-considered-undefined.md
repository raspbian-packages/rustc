## Behavior considered undefined

Rust code, including within `unsafe` blocks and `unsafe` functions is incorrect
if it exhibits any of the behaviors in the following list. It is the
programmer's responsibility when writing `unsafe` code that it is not possible
to let `safe` code exhibit these behaviors.

* Data races.
* Dereferencing a null or dangling raw pointer.
* Unaligned pointer reading and writing outside of [`read_unaligned`]
  and [`write_unaligned`].
* Reads of [undef] \(uninitialized) memory.
* Breaking the [pointer aliasing rules] on accesses through raw pointers;
  a subset of the rules used by C.
* `&mut T` and `&T` follow LLVMâ€™s scoped [noalias] model, except if the `&T`
  contains an [`UnsafeCell<U>`].
* Mutating non-mutable data &mdash; that is, data reached through a shared
  reference or data owned by a `let` binding), unless that data is contained
  within an [`UnsafeCell<U>`].
* Invoking undefined behavior via compiler intrinsics:
  * Indexing outside of the bounds of an object with [`offset`] with
    the exception of one byte past the end of the object.
  * Using [`std::ptr::copy_nonoverlapping_memory`], a.k.a. the `memcpy32`and
    `memcpy64` intrinsics, on overlapping buffers.
* Invalid values in primitive types, even in private fields and locals:
  * Dangling or null references and boxes.
  * A value other than `false` (`0`) or `true` (`1`) in a `bool`.
  * A discriminant in an `enum` not included in the type definition.
  * A value in a `char` which is a surrogate or above `char::MAX`.
  * Non-UTF-8 byte sequences in a `str`.
* Unwinding into Rust from foreign code or unwinding from Rust into foreign
  code. Rust's panic system is not compatible with exception handling in
  other languages. Unwinding must be caught and handled at FFI boundaries.
