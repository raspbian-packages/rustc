# Traits

A _trait_ describes an abstract interface that types can implement. This
interface consists of associated items, which come in three varieties:

- [functions](#associated-functions-and-methods)
- [types](#associated-types)
- [constants](#associated-constants)

All traits define an implicit type parameter `Self` that refers to "the type
that is implementing this interface". Traits may also contain additional type
parameters. These type parameters (including `Self`) may be constrained by
other traits and so forth as usual.

Traits are implemented for specific types through separate [implementations].

## Associated functions and methods

Associated functions whose first parameter is named `self` are called methods
and may be invoked using `.` notation (e.g., `x.foo()`) as well as the usual
function call notation (`foo(x)`).

Consider the following trait:

```rust
# type Surface = i32;
# type BoundingBox = i32;
trait Shape {
    fn draw(&self, Surface);
    fn bounding_box(&self) -> BoundingBox;
}
```

This defines a trait with two methods. All values that have [implementations]
of this trait in scope can have their `draw` and `bounding_box` methods called,
using `value.bounding_box()` [syntax]. Note that `&self` is short for `self:
&Self`, and similarly, `self` is short for `self: Self` and  `&mut self` is
short for `self: &mut Self`.

[implementations]: items/implementations.html
[syntax]: expressions/method-call-expr.html

Traits can include default implementations of methods, as in:

```rust
trait Foo {
    fn bar(&self);
    fn baz(&self) { println!("We called baz."); }
}
```

Here the `baz` method has a default implementation, so types that implement
`Foo` need only implement `bar`. It is also possible for implementing types to
override a method that has a default implementation.

Type parameters can be specified for a trait to make it generic. These appear
after the trait name, using the same syntax used in [generic
functions](items/functions.html#generic-functions).

```rust
trait Seq<T> {
    fn len(&self) -> u32;
    fn elt_at(&self, n: u32) -> T;
    fn iter<F>(&self, F) where F: Fn(T);
}
```

Associated functions may lack a `self` argument, sometimes called 'static
methods'. This means that they can only be called with function call syntax
(`f(x)`) and not method call syntax (`obj.f()`). The way to refer to the name
of a static method is to qualify it with the trait name or type name, treating
the trait name like a module. For example:

```rust
trait Num {
    fn from_i32(n: i32) -> Self;
}
impl Num for f64 {
    fn from_i32(n: i32) -> f64 { n as f64 }
}
let x: f64 = Num::from_i32(42);
let x: f64 = f64::from_i32(42);
```

## Associated Types

It is also possible to define associated types for a trait. Consider the
following example of a `Container` trait. Notice how the type is available for
use in the method signatures:

```rust
trait Container {
    type E;
    fn empty() -> Self;
    fn insert(&mut self, Self::E);
}
```

In order for a type to implement this trait, it must not only provide
implementations for every method, but it must specify the type `E`. Here's an
implementation of `Container` for the standard library type `Vec`:

```rust
# trait Container {
#     type E;
#     fn empty() -> Self;
#     fn insert(&mut self, Self::E);
# }
impl<T> Container for Vec<T> {
    type E = T;
    fn empty() -> Vec<T> { Vec::new() }
    fn insert(&mut self, x: T) { self.push(x); }
}
```

## Associated Constants

A trait can define constants like this:

```rust
trait Foo {
    const ID: i32;
}

impl Foo for i32 {
    const ID: i32 = 1;
}

fn main() {
    assert_eq!(1, i32::ID);
}
```

Any implementor of `Foo` will have to define `ID`. Without the definition:

```rust,compile_fail,E0046
trait Foo {
    const ID: i32;
}

impl Foo for i32 {
}
```

gives

```text
error: not all trait items implemented, missing: `ID` [E0046]
     impl Foo for i32 {
     }
```

A default value can be implemented as well:

```rust
trait Foo {
    const ID: i32 = 1;
}

impl Foo for i32 {
}

impl Foo for i64 {
    const ID: i32 = 5;
}

fn main() {
    assert_eq!(1, i32::ID);
    assert_eq!(5, i64::ID);
}
```

As you can see, when implementing `Foo`, you can leave it unimplemented, as
with `i32`. It will then use the default value. But, as in `i64`, we can also
add our own definition.

Associated constants donâ€™t have to be associated with a trait. An `impl` block
for a `struct` or an `enum` works fine too:

```rust
struct Foo;

impl Foo {
    const FOO: u32 = 3;
}
```

## Trait bounds

Generic functions may use traits as _bounds_ on their type parameters. This
will have three effects:

- Only types that have the trait may instantiate the parameter.
- Within the generic function, the methods of the trait can be called on values
  that have the parameter's type. Associated types can be used in the
  function's signature, and associated constants can be used in expressions
  within the function body.
- Generic functions and types with the same or weaker bounds can use the
  generic type in the function body or signature.

For example:

```rust
# type Surface = i32;
# trait Shape { fn draw(&self, Surface); }
struct Figure<S: Shape>(S, S);
fn draw_twice<T: Shape>(surface: Surface, sh: T) {
    sh.draw(surface);
    sh.draw(surface);
}
fn draw_figure<U: Shape>(surface: Surface, Figure(sh1, sh2): Figure<U>) {
    sh1.draw(surface);
    draw_twice(surface, sh2); // Can call this since U: Shape
}
```

## Trait objects

Traits also define a [trait object] with the same name as the trait. Values of
this type are created by coercing from a pointer of some specific type to a
pointer of trait type. For example, `&T` could be coerced to `&Shape` if `T:
Shape` holds (and similarly for `Box<T>`). This coercion can either be implicit
or [explicit]. Here is an example of an explicit coercion:

[trait object]: types.html#trait-objects
[explicit]: expressions/operator-expr.html#type-cast-expressions

```rust
trait Shape { }
impl Shape for i32 { }
let mycircle = 0i32;
let myshape: Box<Shape> = Box::new(mycircle) as Box<Shape>;
```

The resulting value is a box containing the value that was cast, along with
information that identifies the methods of the implementation that was used.
Values with a trait type can have [methods called] on them, for any method in
the trait, and can be used to instantiate type parameters that are bounded by
the trait.

## Supertraits

Trait bounds on `Self` are considered "supertraits". These are required to be
acyclic.  Supertraits are somewhat different from other constraints in that
they affect what methods are available in the vtable when the trait is used as
a [trait object]. Consider the following example:

```rust
trait Shape { fn area(&self) -> f64; }
trait Circle : Shape { fn radius(&self) -> f64; }
```

The syntax `Circle : Shape` means that types that implement `Circle` must also
have an implementation for `Shape`. Multiple supertraits are separated by `+`,
`trait Circle : Shape + PartialEq { }`. In an implementation of `Circle` for a
given type `T`, methods can refer to `Shape` methods, since the typechecker
checks that any type with an implementation of `Circle` also has an
implementation of `Shape`:

```rust
struct Foo;

trait Shape { fn area(&self) -> f64; }
trait Circle : Shape { fn radius(&self) -> f64; }
impl Shape for Foo {
    fn area(&self) -> f64 {
        0.0
    }
}
impl Circle for Foo {
    fn radius(&self) -> f64 {
        println!("calling area: {}", self.area());

        0.0
    }
}

let c = Foo;
c.radius();
```

In type-parameterized functions, methods of the supertrait may be called on
values of subtrait-bound type parameters. Referring to the previous example of
`trait Circle : Shape`:

```rust
# trait Shape { fn area(&self) -> f64; }
# trait Circle : Shape { fn radius(&self) -> f64; }
fn radius_times_area<T: Circle>(c: T) -> f64 {
    // `c` is both a Circle and a Shape
    c.radius() * c.area()
}
```

Likewise, supertrait methods may also be called on trait objects.

```rust
# trait Shape { fn area(&self) -> f64; }
# trait Circle : Shape { fn radius(&self) -> f64; }
# impl Shape for i32 { fn area(&self) -> f64 { 0.0 } }
# impl Circle for i32 { fn radius(&self) -> f64 { 0.0 } }
# let mycircle = 0i32;
let mycircle = Box::new(mycircle) as Box<Circle>;
let nonsense = mycircle.radius() * mycircle.area();
```
