# About this guide

This guide is meant to help document how rustc – the Rust compiler –
works, as well as to help new contributors get involved in rustc
development. It is not meant to replace code documentation – each
chapter gives only high-level details – the kinds of things that
(ideally) don't change frequently.

The guide itself is of course open-source as well, and the sources can
be found at the [GitHub repository]. If you find any mistakes in the
guide, please file an issue about it, or even better, open a PR
with a correction!
