# An I/O Project: Building a Command Line Program

This chapter is both a recap of the many skills you’ve learned so far and an
exploration of a few more standard library features. We’re going to build a
command line tool that interacts with file and command line input/output to
practice some of the Rust you now have under your belt.

Rust’s speed, safety, *single binary* output, and cross-platform support make
it a good language for creating command line tools, so for our project we’ll
make our own version of the classic command line tool `grep`. Grep is an
acronym for “Globally search a Regular Expression and Print.” In the simplest
use case, `grep` searches a specified file for a specified string. To do so,
`grep` takes a filename and a string as its arguments, then reads the file and
finds lines in that file that contain the string argument. It’ll then print out
those lines.

Along the way, we’ll show how to make our command line tool use features of the
terminal that many command line tools use. We'll read the value of an
environment variable in order to allow the user to configure the behavior of
our tool. We'll print to the standard error console stream (`stderr`) instead
of standard output (`stdout`) so that, for example, the user can choose to
redirect successful output to a file while still seeing error messages on the
screen.

One Rust community member, Andrew Gallant, has already created a
fully-featured, very fast version of `grep`, called `ripgrep`. By comparison,
our version of `grep` will be fairly simple, but this chapter will give you
some of the background knowledge to help you understand a real-world project
like `ripgrep`.

This project will bring together a number of concepts you’ve learned so far:

* Organizing code (using what we learned in modules, Chapter 7)
* Using vectors and strings (collections, Chapter 8)
* Handling errors (Chapter 9)
* Using traits and lifetimes where appropriate (Chapter 10)
* Writing tests (Chapter 11)

We’ll also briefly introduce closures, iterators, and trait objects, which
Chapters 13 and 17 will cover in detail.

Let’s create a new project with, as always, `cargo new`. We’re calling our
project `minigrep` to distinguish from the `grep` tool that you may already
have on your system:

```
$ cargo new --bin minigrep
     Created binary (application) `minigrep` project
$ cd minigrep
```

## Accepting Command Line Arguments

Our first task is to make `minigrep` able to accept its two command line
arguments: the filename and a string to search for. That is, we want to be able
to run our program with `cargo run`, a string to search for, and a path to a
file to search in, like so:

```
$ cargo run searchstring example-filename.txt
```

Right now, the program generated by `cargo new` cannot process arguments we
give it. There are some existing libraries on crates.io that can help us accept
command line arguments, but since you’re learning, let’s implement this
ourselves.

### Reading the Argument Values

We first need to make sure our program is able to get the values of command
line arguments we pass to it, for which we’ll need a function provided in
Rust’s standard library: `std::env::args`. This function returns an *iterator*
of the command line arguments that were given to our program. We haven’t
discussed iterators yet, and we’ll cover them fully in Chapter 13, but for our
purposes now we only need to know two things about iterators: Iterators produce
a series of values, and we can call the `collect` function on an iterator to
turn it into a collection, such as a vector, containing all of the elements the
iterator produces.

Let’s give it a try: use the code in Listing 12-1 to allow your `minigrep`
program to read any command line arguments passed it and then collect the
values into a vector.

Filename: src/main.rs

```
use std::env;

fn main() {
    let args: Vec<String> = env::args().collect();
    println!("{:?}", args);
}
```

Listing 12-1: Collect the command line arguments into a vector and print them
out

First, we bring the `std::env` module into scope with a `use` statement so that
we can use its `args` function. Notice the `std::env::args` function is nested
in two levels of modules. As we talked about in Chapter 7, in cases where the
desired function is nested in more than one module, it’s conventional to bring
the parent module into scope, rather than the function itself. This lets us
easily use other functions from `std::env`. It’s also less ambiguous than
adding `use std::env::args;` then calling the function with just `args`; that
might easily be mistaken for a function that’s defined in the current module.

> ### The `args` Function and Invalid Unicode
>
> Note that `std::env::args` will panic if any argument contains invalid
> Unicode. If you need to accept arguments containing invalid Unicode, use
> `std::env::args_os` instead. That function returns `OsString` values instead
> of `String` values. We’ve chosen to use `std::env::args` here for simplicity
> because `OsString` values differ per-platform and are more complex to work
> with than `String` values.

On the first line of `main`, we call `env::args`, and immediately use `collect`
to turn the iterator into a vector containing all of the values produced by the
iterator. The `collect` function can be used to create many kinds of
collections, so we explicitly annotate the type of `args` to specify that we
want a vector of strings. Though we very rarely need to annotate types in Rust,
`collect` is one function you do often need to annotate because Rust isn’t able
to infer what kind of collection you want.

Finally, we print out the vector with the debug formatter, `:?`. Let’s try
running our code with no arguments, and then with two arguments:

```
$ cargo run
["target/debug/minigrep"]

$ cargo run needle haystack
...snip...
["target/debug/minigrep", "needle", "haystack"]
```

You may notice that the first value in the vector is `"target/debug/minigrep"`,
which is the name of our binary. This matches the behavior of the arguments
list in C, and lets programs use the name by which they were invoked in their
execution. It's convenient to have access to the program name in case we want
to print it in messages or change behavior of the program based on what command
line alias was used to invoke the program, but for the purposes of this chapter
we're going to ignore it and only save the two arguments we need.

### Saving the Argument Values in Variables

Printing out the value of the vector of arguments has illustrated that the
program is able to access the values specified as command line arguments.
That’s not actually our end goal, though: we want to save the values of the two
arguments in variables so that we can use the values in our program. Let’s do
that as shown in Listing 12-2:

Filename: src/main.rs

```
use std::env;

fn main() {
    let args: Vec<String> = env::args().collect();

    let query = &args[1];
    let filename = &args[2];

    println!("Searching for {}", query);
    println!("In file {}", filename);
}
```

Listing 12-2: Create variables to hold the query argument and filename argument

As we saw when we printed out the vector, the program’s name takes up the first
value in the vector at `args[0]`, so that we’re starting at index `1`. The
first argument `minigrep` takes is the string we’re searching for, so we put a
reference to the first argument in the variable `query`. The second argument
will be the filename, so we put a reference to the second argument in the
variable `filename`.

We’re temporarily printing out the values of these variables, again to prove to
ourselves that our code is working as we intend. Let’s try running this program
again with the arguments `test` and `sample.txt`:

```
$ cargo run test sample.txt
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.0 secs
     Running `target/debug/minigrep test sample.txt`
Searching for test
In file sample.txt
```

Great, it’s working! The values of the arguments we need are being saved into
the right variables. Later we’ll add some error handling to deal with certain
potential erroneous situations, such as when the user provides no arguments,
but for now we’ll ignore that and work on adding file reading capabilities
instead.

## Reading a File

Next, we’re going to add functionality to read the file that specified in the
`filename` command line argument. First, we need a sample file to test it
with—the best kind of file to use to make sure that `minigrep` is working is
one with a small amount of text over multiple lines with some repeated words.
Listing 12-3 has an Emily Dickinson poem that will work well! Create a file
called `poem.txt` at the root level of your project, and enter the poem “I’m
nobody! Who are you?”:

Filename: poem.txt

```
I’m nobody! Who are you?
Are you nobody, too?
Then there’s a pair of us — don’t tell!
They’d banish us, you know.

How dreary to be somebody!
How public, like a frog
To tell your name the livelong day
To an admiring bog!
```

Listing 12-3: The poem “I’m nobody! Who are you?” by Emily Dickinson that will
make a good test case

With that in place, edit *src/main.rs* and add code to open the file as shown
in Listing 12-4:

Filename: src/main.rs

```
use std::env;
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    // ...snip...
    println!("In file {}", filename);
    let mut f = File::open(filename).expect("file not found");

    let mut contents = String::new();
    f.read_to_string(&mut contents)
        .expect("something went wrong reading the file");

    println!("With text:\n{}", contents);
}
```

Listing 12-4: Reading the contents of the file specified by the second argument

First, we add some more `use` statements to bring in relevant parts of the
standard library: we need `std::fs::File` for dealing with files, and
`std::io::prelude::*` contains various traits that are useful when doing I/O,
including file I/O. In the same way that Rust has a general prelude that brings
certain things into scope automatically, the `std::io` module has its own
prelude of common things you’ll need when working with I/O. Unlike the default
prelude, we must explicitly `use` the prelude from `std::io`.

In `main`, we’ve added three things: first, we get a mutable handle to the file
by calling the `File::open` function and passing it the value of the `filename`
variable. Second, we create a variable called `contents` and set it to a
mutable, empty `String`. This will hold the content of the file after we read
it in. Third, we call `read_to_string` on our file handle and pass a mutable
reference to `contents` as an argument.

After those lines, we’ve again added a temporary `println!` statement that
prints out the value of `contents` after the file is read, so that we can check
that our program is working so far.

Let’s try running this code with any string as the first command line argument
(since we haven’t implemented the searching part yet) and our *poem.txt* file
as the second argument:

```
$ cargo run the poem.txt
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.0 secs
     Running `target/debug/minigrep the poem.txt`
Searching for the
In file poem.txt
With text:
I’m nobody! Who are you?
Are you nobody, too?
Then there’s a pair of us — don’t tell!
They’d banish us, you know.

How dreary to be somebody!
How public, like a frog
To tell your name the livelong day
To an admiring bog!
```

Great! Our code read in and printed out the content of the file. We’ve got a
few flaws though. The `main` function has multiple responsibilities; generally
functions are clearer and easier to maintain if each function is responsible
for only one idea. The other problem is that we’re not handling errors as well
as we could be. While our program is still small, these flaws aren’t a big
problem, but as our program grows, it will be harder to fix them cleanly. It’s
good practice to begin refactoring early on when developing a program, as it’s
much easier to refactor smaller amounts of code, so we’ll do that now.

## Refactoring to Improve Modularity and Error Handling

There are four problems that we’d like to fix to improve our program, and they
have to do with the way the program is structured and how it’s handling
potential errors.

First, our `main` function now performs two tasks: it parses arguments and
opens up files. For such a small function, this isn’t a huge problem. However,
if we keep growing our program inside of `main`, the number of separate tasks
the `main` function handles will grow. As a function gains responsibilities, it
gets harder to reason about, harder to test, and harder to change without
breaking one of its parts. It’s better to separate out functionality so that
each function is responsible for one task.

This also ties into our second problem: while `query` and `filename` are
configuration variables to our program, variables like `f` and `contents` are
used to perform our program’s logic. The longer `main` gets, the more variables
we’re going to need to bring into scope; the more variables we have in scope,
the harder it is to keep track of the purpose of each. It’s better to group the
configuration variables into one structure to make their purpose clear.

The third problem is that we’ve used `expect` to print out an error message
when opening the file fails, but the error message only says `file not found`.
There are a number of ways that opening a file can fail besides the file being
missing: for example, the file might exist, but we might not have permission to
open it. Right now, if we’re in that situation, we’d print the `file not found`
error message that would give the user the wrong advice!

Fourth, we use `expect` repeatedly to deal with different errors, and if the
user runs our programs without specifying enough arguments, they’ll get an
“index out of bounds” error from Rust that doesn’t clearly explain the problem.
It would be better if all our error handling code was in one place so that
future maintainers only have one place to consult in the code if the error
handling logic needs to change. Having all the error handling code in one place
will also help us to ensure that we’re printing messages that will be
meaningful to our end users.

Let’s address these problems by refactoring our project.

### Separation of Concerns for Binary Projects

The organizational problem of allocating responsibility for multiple tasks to
the `main` function responsible is common to many binary projects, so the Rust
community has developed a kind of guideline process for splitting up the
separate concerns of a binary program when `main` starts getting large. The
process has the following steps:

* Split your program into both a *main.rs* and a *lib.rs* and move your
program’s logic into *lib.rs*.
* While your command line parsing logic is small, it can remain in *main.rs*.
* When the command line parsing logic starts getting complicated, extract it
from *main.rs* into *lib.rs* as well.
* The responsibilities that remain in the `main` function after this process
should be limited to:
  * Calling the command line parsing logic with the argument values
  * Setting up any other configuration
  * Calling a `run` function in *lib.rs*
  * If `run` returns an error, handling that error

This pattern is all about separating concerns: *main.rs* handles running the
program, and *lib.rs* handles all of the logic of the task at hand. Because we
can’t test the `main` function directly, this structure lets us test all of our
program’s logic by moving it into functions in *lib.rs*. The only code that
remains in *main.rs* will be small enough to verify its correctness by reading
it. Let’s re-work our program by following this process.

#### Extracting the Argument Parser

First, we’ll extract the functionality for parsing arguments. Listing 12-5
shows the new start of `main` that calls a new function `parse_config`, which
we’re still going to define in *src/main.rs* for the moment:

Filename: src/main.rs

```
fn main() {
    let args: Vec<String> = env::args().collect();

    let (query, filename) = parse_config(&args);

    // ...snip...
}

fn parse_config(args: &[String]) -> (&str, &str) {
    let query = &args[1];
    let filename = &args[2];

    (query, filename)
}
```

Listing 12-5: Extract a `parse_config` function from `main`

We’re still collecting the command line arguments into a vector, but instead of
assigning the argument value at index `1` to the variable `query` and the
argument value at index `2` to the variable `filename` within the `main`
function, we pass the whole vector to the `parse_config` function. The
`parse_config` function then holds the logic that determines which argument
goes in which variable, and passes the values back to `main`. We still create
the `query` and `filename` variables in `main`, but `main` no longer has the
responsibility of determining how the command line arguments and variables
correspond.

This may seem like overkill for our small program, but we’re refactoring in
small, incremental steps. After making this change, run the program again to
verify that the argument parsing still works. It’s good to check your progress
often, as that will help you identify the cause of problems when they occur.

#### Grouping Configuration Values

We can take another small step to improve this function further. At the moment,
we’re returning a tuple, but then we immediately break that tuple up into
individual parts again. This is a sign that perhaps we don’t have the right
abstraction yet.

Another indicator that there’s room for improvement is the `config` part of
`parse_config`, which implies that the two values we return are related and are
both part of one configuration value. We’re not currently conveying this
meaning in the structure of the data other than grouping the two values into a
tuple: we could put the two values into one struct and give each of the struct
fields a meaningful name. This will make it easier for future maintainers of
this code to understand how the different values relate to each other and what
their purpose is.

> Note: some people call this anti-pattern of using primitive values when a
> complex type would be more appropriate *primitive obsession*.

Listing 12-6 shows the addition of a struct named `Config` defined to have
fields named `query` and `filename`. We’ve also changed the `parse_config`
function to return an instance of the `Config` struct, and updated `main` to
use the struct fields rather than having separate variables:

Filename: src/main.rs

```
fn main() {
    let args: Vec<String> = env::args().collect();

    let config = parse_config(&args);

    println!("Searching for {}", config.query);
    println!("In file {}", config.filename);

    let mut f = File::open(config.filename).expect("file not found");

    // ...snip...
}

struct Config {
    query: String,
    filename: String,
}

fn parse_config(args: &[String]) -> Config {
    let query = args[1].clone();
    let filename = args[2].clone();

    Config { query, filename }
}
```

Listing 12-6: Refactoring `parse_config` to return an instance of a `Config`
struct

The signature of `parse_config` now indicates that it returns a `Config` value.
In the body of `parse_config`, where we used to return string slices that
reference `String` values in `args`, we’ve now chosen to define `Config` to
contain owned `String` values. The `args` variable in `main` is the owner of
the argument values and is only letting the `parse_config` function borrow
them, though, which means we’d violate Rust’s borrowing rules if `Config` tried
to take ownership of the values in `args`.

There are a number of different ways we could manage the `String` data, and the
easiest, though somewhat inefficient, route is to call the `clone` method on
the values. This will make a full copy of the data for the `Config` instance to
own, which does take more time and memory than storing a reference to the
string data. However, cloning the data also makes our code very straightforward
since we don’t have to manage the lifetimes of the references, so in this
circumstance giving up a little performance to gain simplicity is a worthwhile
trade-off.

We’ve updated `main` so that it places the instance of `Config` returned by
`parse_config` into a variable named `config`, and updated the code that
previously used the separate `query` and `filename` variables so that it now
uses the fields on the `Config` struct instead.

Our code now more clearly conveys that `query` and `filename` are related and
their purpose is to configure how the program will work. Any code that uses
these values knows to find them in the `config` instance in the fields named
for their purpose.

#### Creating a Constructor for `Config`

So far, we’ve extracted the logic responsible for parsing the command line
arguments from `main` into the `parse_config` function, which helped us to see
that the `query` and `filename` values were related and that relationship
should be conveyed in our code. We then added a `Config` struct to name the
related purpose of `query` and `filename`, and to be able to return the values’
names as struct field names from the `parse_config` function.

So now that the purpose of the `parse_config` function is to create a `Config`
instance, we can change `parse_config` from being a plain function into a
function named `new` that is associated with the `Config` struct. Making this
change will make our code more idiomatic: we can create instances of types in
the standard library like `String` by calling `String::new`, and by changing
`parse_config` into a `new` function associated with `Config`, we’ll be able to
create instances of `Config` by calling `Config::new`. Listing 12-7 shows the
changes we’ll need to make:

Filename: src/main.rs

```
fn main() {
    let args: Vec<String> = env::args().collect();

    let config = Config::new(&args);

    // ...snip...
}

// ...snip...

impl Config {
    fn new(args: &[String]) -> Config {
        let query = args[1].clone();
        let filename = args[2].clone();

        Config { query, filename }
    }
}
```

Listing 12-7: Changing `parse_config` into `Config::new`

We’ve updated `main` where we were calling `parse_config` to instead call
`Config::new`. We’ve changed the name of `parse_config` to `new` and moved it
within an `impl` block, which makes the `new` function associated with
`Config`. Try compiling this again to make sure it works.

### Fixing the Error Handling

Now we’ll work on fixing our error handling. Recall that we mentioned that
attempting to access the values in the `args` vector at index `1` or index `2`
will cause the program to panic if the vector contains fewer than 3 items. Try
running the program without any arguments; it will look like this:

```
$ cargo run
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.0 secs
     Running `target/debug/minigrep`
thread 'main' panicked at 'index out of bounds: the len is 1
but the index is 1', /stable-dist-rustc/build/src/libcollections/vec.rs:1307
note: Run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` for a backtrace.
```

The line that states `index out of bounds: the len is 1 but the index is 1` is
an error message intended for programmers, and won’t really help our end users
understand what happened and what they should do instead. Let’s fix that now.

#### Improving the Error Message

In Listing 12-8, we’re adding a check in the `new` function that will check
that the slice is long enough before accessing index `1` and `2`. If the slice
isn’t long enough, the program panics, with a better error message than the
`index out of bounds` message:

Filename: src/main.rs

```
// ...snip...
fn new(args: &[String]) -> Config {
    if args.len() < 3 {
        panic!("not enough arguments");
    }
    // ...snip...
```

Listing 12-8: Adding a check for the number of arguments

This is similar to the `Guess::new` function we wrote in Listing 9-8, where
`panic!` was called when the `value` argument was out of the range of valid
values. Instead of checking for a range of values here, we’re checking that the
length of `args` is at least 3, and the rest of the function can operate under
the assumption that this condition has been met. If `args` has fewer than 3
items, this condition will be true, and we call the `panic!` macro to end the
program immediately.

With these extra few lines of code in `new`, let’s try running our program
without any arguments again and see what the error looks like now:

```
$ cargo run
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.0 secs
     Running `target/debug/minigrep`
thread 'main' panicked at 'not enough arguments', src/main.rs:29
note: Run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` for a backtrace.
```

This output is better, we now have a reasonable error message. However, we also
have a bunch of extra information we don’t want to give to our users. So
perhaps using the technique we used in Listing 9-8 isn’t the best to use here;
a call to `panic!` is more appropriate for a programming problem rather than a
usage problem, as we discussed in Chapter 9. Instead, we can use the other
technique you also learned about in Chapter 9: returning a `Result` that can
indicate either success or an error.

#### Returning a `Result` from `new` Instead of Calling `panic!`

We can choose to instead return a `Result` value that will contain a `Config`
instance in the successful case, and will describe the problem in the error
case. When `Config::new` is communicating to `main`, we can use the `Result`
type to signal that there was a problem. Then we can change `main` to convert
an `Err` variant into a more practical error for our users, without the
surrounding text about `thread 'main'` and `RUST_BACKTRACE` that a call to
`panic!` causes.

Listing 12-9 shows the changes you need to make to the return value of
`Config::new` and the body of the function needed to return a `Result`:

Filename: src/main.rs

```
impl Config {
    fn new(args: &[String]) -> Result<Config, &'static str> {
        if args.len() < 3 {
            return Err("not enough arguments");
        }

        let query = args[1].clone();
        let filename = args[2].clone();

        Ok(Config { query, filename })
    }
}
```

Listing 12-9: Return a `Result` from `Config::new`

Our `new` function now returns a `Result`, with a `Config` instance in the
success case and a `&'static str` in the error case. Recall from “The Static
Lifetime” section in Chapter 10 that `&'static str` is the type of string
literals, which is our error message type for now.

We’ve made two changes in the body of the `new` function: instead of calling
`panic!` when the user doesn’t pass enough arguments, we now return an `Err`
value, and we’ve wrapped the `Config` return value in an `Ok`. These changes
make the function conform to its new type signature.

By having `Config::new` return an `Err` value, it allows the `main` function to
handle the `Result` value returned from the `new` function and exit the process
more cleanly in the error case.

#### Calling `Config::new` and Handling Errors

In order to handle the error case and print a user-friendly message, we need to
update `main` to handle the `Result` being returned by `Config::new`, as shown
in Listing 12-10. We’re also going to take the responsibility of exiting the
command line tool with a nonzero error code from `panic!` and implement it by
hand. A nonzero exit status is a convention to signal to the process that
called our program that our program ended with an error state.

Filename: src/main.rs

```
use std::process;

fn main() {
    let args: Vec<String> = env::args().collect();

    let config = Config::new(&args).unwrap_or_else(|err| {
        println!("Problem parsing arguments: {}", err);
        process::exit(1);
    });

    // ...snip...
```

Listing 12-10: Exiting with an error code if creating a new `Config` fails

In this listing, we’re using a method we haven’t covered before:
`unwrap_or_else`, which is defined on `Result<T, E>` by the standard library.
Using `unwrap_or_else` allows us to define some custom, non-`panic!` error
handling. If the `Result` is an `Ok` value, this method’s behavior is similar
to `unwrap`: it returns the inner value `Ok` is wrapping. However, if the value
is an `Err` value, this method calls the code in the *closure*, which is an
anonymous function we define and pass as an argument to `unwrap_or_else`. We’ll
be covering closures in more detail in Chapter 13. What you need to know for
now is that `unwrap_or_else` will pass the inner value of the `Err`, which in
this case is the static string `not enough arguments` that we added in Listing
12-9, to our closure in the argument `err` that appears between the vertical
pipes. The code in the closure can then use the `err` value when it runs.

We’ve added a new `use` line to import `process` from the standard library. The
code in the closure that will get run in the error case is only two lines: we
print out the `err` value, then call `process::exit`. The `process::exit`
function will stop the program immediately and return the number that was
passed as the exit status code. This is similar to the `panic!`-based handling
we used in Listing 12-8, with the exception that we no longer get all the extra
output. Let’s try it:

```
$ cargo run
   Compiling minigrep v0.1.0 (file:///projects/minigrep)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.48 secs
     Running `target/debug/minigrep`
Problem parsing arguments: not enough arguments
```

Great! This output is much friendlier for our users.

### Extracting Logic from `main`

Now we’re done refactoring our configuration parsing; let’s turn to our
program’s logic. As we laid out in the “Separation of Concerns for Binary
Projects” section, we’re going to extract a function named `run` that will hold
all of the logic currently in the `main` function not involved with setting up
configuration or handling errors. Once we’re done, `main` will be concise and
easy to verify by inspection, and we’ll be able to write tests for all of the
other logic.

Listing 12-11 shows the extracted `run` function. For now, we’re making only
the small, incremental improvement of extracting the function. We’re still
defining the function in *src/main.rs*:

Filename: src/main.rs

```
fn main() {
    // ...snip...

    println!("Searching for {}", config.query);
    println!("In file {}", config.filename);

    run(config);
}

fn run(config: Config) {
    let mut f = File::open(config.filename).expect("file not found");

    let mut contents = String::new();
    f.read_to_string(&mut contents)
        .expect("something went wrong reading the file");

    println!("With text:\n{}", contents);
}

// ...snip...
```

Listing 12-11: Extracting a `run` function containing the rest of the program
logic

The `run` function now contains all the remaining logic from `main` starting
from reading the file. The `run` function takes the `Config` instance as an
argument.

#### Returning Errors from the `run` Function

With the remaining program logic separated into the `run` function, we can
improve the error handling like we did with `Config::new` in Listing 12-9.
Instead of allowing the program to panic by calling `expect`, the `run`
function will return a `Result<T, E>` when something goes wrong. This will let
us further consolidate the logic around handling errors in a user-friendly way
into `main`. Listing 12-12 shows the changes you need to make to the signature
and body of `run`:

Filename: src/main.rs

```
use std::error::Error;

// ...snip...

fn run(config: Config) -> Result<(), Box<Error>> {
    let mut f = File::open(config.filename)?;

    let mut contents = String::new();
    f.read_to_string(&mut contents)?;

    println!("With text:\n{}", contents);

    Ok(())
}
```

Listing 12-12: Changing the `run` function to return `Result`

We’ve made three big changes here. First, we’re changing the return type of the
`run` function to `Result<(), Box<Error>>`. This function previously returned
the unit type, `()`, and we keep that as the value returned in the `Ok` case.

For our error type, we’re using the *trait object* `Box<Error>` (and we’ve
brought `std::error::Error` into scope with a `use` statement at the top).
We’ll be covering trait objects in Chapter 17. For now, just know that
`Box<Error>` means the function will return a type that implements the `Error`
trait, but we don’t have to specify what particular type the return value will
be. This gives us flexibility to return error values that may be of different
types in different error cases.

The second change we’re making is removing the calls to `expect` in favor of
`?`, like we talked about in Chapter 9. Rather than `panic!` on an error, this
will return the error value from the current function for the caller to handle.

Thirdly, this function now returns an `Ok` value in the success case. We’ve
declared the `run` function’s success type as `()` in the signature, which
means we need to wrap the unit type value in the `Ok` value. This `Ok(())`
syntax may look a bit strange at first, but using `()` like this is the
idiomatic way to indicate that we’re calling `run` for its side effects only;
it doesn’t return a value we need.

When you run this, it will compile, but with a warning:

```
warning: unused result which must be used, #[warn(unused_must_use)] on by
default
  --> src/main.rs:39:5
   |
39 |     run(config);
   |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^
```

Rust is telling us that our code ignores the `Result` value, which might be
indicating that there was an error. We’re not checking to see if there was an
error or not, though, and the compiler is reminding us that we probably meant
to have some error handling code here! Let’s rectify that now.

#### Handling Errors Returned from `run` in `main`

We’ll check for errors and handle them using a similar technique to the way we
handled errors with `Config::new` in Listing 12-10, but with a slight
difference:

Filename: src/main.rs

```
fn main() {
    // ...snip...

    println!("Searching for {}", config.query);
    println!("In file {}", config.filename);

    if let Err(e) = run(config) {
        println!("Application error: {}", e);

        process::exit(1);
    }
}
```

We use `if let` to check whether `run` returns an `Err` value, rather than
`unwrap_or_else`, and call `process::exit(1)` if it does. `run` doesn’t return
a value that we want to `unwrap` like `Config::new` returns the `Config`
instance. Because `run` returns a `()` in the success case, we only care about
detecting an error, so we don’t need `unwrap_or_else` to return the unwrapped
value as it would only be `()`.

The bodies of the `if let` and the `unwrap_or_else` functions are the same in
both cases though: we print out the error and exit.

### Splitting Code into a Library Crate

This is looking pretty good so far! Now we’re going to split the *src/main.rs*
file up and put some code into *src/lib.rs* so that we can test it and have a
*src/main.rs* file with fewer responsibilities.

Let’s move everything that isn't the `main` function from *src/main.rs* to a
new file, *src/lib.rs*:

* The `run` function definition
* The relevant `use` statements
* The definition of `Config`
* The `Config::new` function definition

The contents of *src/lib.rs* should have the signatures shown in Listing 12-13
(we've omitted the bodies of the functions for brevity):

Filename: src/lib.rs

```
use std::error::Error;
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::prelude::*;

pub struct Config {
    pub query: String,
    pub filename: String,
}

impl Config {
    pub fn new(args: &[String]) -> Result<Config, &'static str> {
        // ...snip...
    }
}

pub fn run(config: Config) -> Result<(), Box<Error>> {
    // ...snip...
}
```

Listing 12-13: Moving `Config` and `run` into *src/lib.rs*

We’ve made liberal use of `pub` here: on `Config`, its fields and its `new`
method, and on the `run` function. We now have a library crate that has a
public API that we can test!

Now we need to bring the code we moved to *src/lib.rs* into the scope of the
binary crate in *src/main.rs* by using `extern crate minigrep`. Then we’ll add
a `use minigrep::Config` line to bring the `Config` type into scope, and prefix
the `run` function with our crate name as shown in Listing 12-14:

Filename: src/main.rs

```
extern crate minigrep;

use std::env;
use std::process;

use minigrep::Config;

fn main() {
    // ...snip...
    if let Err(e) = minigrep::run(config) {
        // ...snip...
    }
}
```

Listing 12-14: Bringing the `minigrep` crate into the scope of *src/main.rs*

To bring the library crate into the binary crate, we use `extern crate`
`minigrep`. Then we’ll add a `use` `minigrep``::Config` line to bring the
`Config` type into scope, and we'll prefix the `run` function with our crate
name. With that, all the functionality should be connected and should work.
Give it a `cargo run` and make sure everything is wired up correctly.

Whew! That was a lot of work, but we’ve set ourselves up for success in the
future. Now it’s much easier to handle errors, and we’ve made our code more
modular. Almost all of our work will be done in *src/lib.rs* from here on out.

Let’s take advantage of this newfound modularity by doing something that would
have been hard with our old code, but is easy with our new code: write some
tests!

## Testing the Library’s Functionality

Now that we’ve extracted the logic into *src/lib.rs* and left all the argument
parsing and error handling in *src/main.rs*, it’s much easier for us to write
tests for the core functionality of our code. We can call our functions
directly with various arguments and check return values without having to call
our binary from the command line.

In this section, we’re going to follow the Test Driven Development (TDD)
process. This is a software development technique that follows this set of
steps:

* Write a test that fails, and run it to make sure it fails for the reason you
expected.
* Write or modify just enough code to make the new test pass.
* Refactor the code you just added or changed, and make sure the tests continue
to pass.
* Repeat!

This is just one of many ways to write software, but TDD can help drive the
design of code. Writing the test before you write the code that makes the test
pass helps to maintain high test coverage throughout the process.

We’re going to test drive the implementation of the functionality that will
actually do the searching for the query string in the file contents and produce
a list of lines that match the query. We’re going to add this functionality in
a function called `search`.

### Writing a Failing Test

First, since we don’t really need them any more, let’s remove the `println!`
statements from both *src/lib.rs* and *src/main.rs*. Then we’ll add a `test`
module with a test function like we did in Chapter 11. The test function
specifies the behavior we’d like the `search` function to have: it will take a
query and the text to search for the query in, and will return only the lines
from the text that contain the query. Listing 12-15 shows this test:

Filename: src/lib.rs

```
#[cfg(test)]
mod test {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn one_result() {
        let query = "duct";
        let contents = "\
Rust:
safe, fast, productive.
Pick three.";

        assert_eq!(
            vec!["safe, fast, productive."],
            search(query, contents)
        );
    }
}
```

Listing 12-15: Creating a failing test for the `search` function we wish we had

The string we are searching for is “duct” in this test. The text we’re
searching is three lines, only one of which contains “duct”. We assert that the
value returned from the `search` function contains only the line we expect.

We aren’t able to run this test and watch it fail though, since this test
doesn’t even compile–the search function doesn't exist yet! So now we’ll add
just enough code to get the tests to compile and run: a definition of the
`search` function that always returns an empty vector, as shown in Listing
12-16. Once we have this, the test should compile and fail because an empty
vector doesn’t match a vector containing the line `"safe, fast, productive."`.

Filename: src/lib.rs

```
pub fn search<'a>(query: &str, contents: &'a str) -> Vec<&'a str> {
    vec![]
}
```

Listing 12-16: Defining just enough of the `search` function so that our test
will compile

Notice that we need an explicit lifetime `'a` defined in the signature of
`search` and used with the `contents` argument and the return value. Remember
from Chapter 10 that the lifetime parameters specify which argument lifetime is
connected to the lifetime of the return value. In this case, we’re indicating
that the returned vector should contain string slices that reference slices of
the argument `contents` (rather than the argument `query`).

In other words, we’re telling Rust that the data returned by the `search`
function will live as long as the data passed into the `search` function in the
`contents` argument. This is important! The data referenced *by* a slice needs
to be valid in order for the reference to be valid; if the compiler assumed we
were making string slices of `query` rather than `contents`, it would do its
safety checking incorrectly.

If we tried to compile this function without lifetimes, we would get this error:

```
error[E0106]: missing lifetime specifier
 --> src/lib.rs:5:47
  |
5 | fn search(query: &str, contents: &str) -> Vec<&str> {
  |                                               ^ expected lifetime parameter
  |
  = help: this function's return type contains a borrowed value, but the
  signature does not say whether it is borrowed from `query` or `contents`
```

Rust can’t possibly know which of the two arguments we need, so we need to tell
it. Because `contents` is the argument that contains all of our text and we
want to return the parts of that text that match, we know `contents` is the
argument that should be connected to the return value using the lifetime syntax.

Other programming languages don’t require you to connect arguments to return
values in the signature, so this may still feel strange, but will get easier
over time. You may want to compare this example with the Lifetime Syntax
section in Chapter 10.

Now let’s try running our test:

```
$ cargo test
...warnings...
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.43 secs
     Running target/debug/deps/minigrep-abcabcabc

running 1 test
test test::one_result ... FAILED

failures:

---- test::one_result stdout ----
    thread 'test::one_result' panicked at 'assertion failed: `(left == right)`
(left: `["safe, fast, productive."]`, right: `[]`)', src/lib.rs:16
note: Run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` for a backtrace.


failures:
    test::one_result

test result: FAILED. 0 passed; 1 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured

error: test failed
```

Great, our test fails, exactly as we expected. Let’s get the test to pass!

### Writing Code to Pass the Test

Currently, our test is failing because we always return an empty vector. To fix
that and implement `search`, our program needs to follow these steps:

* Iterate through each line of the contents.
* Check if the line contains our query string.
* If it does, add it to the list of values we’re returning.
* If it doesn’t, do nothing.
* Return the list of results that match.

Let’s take each step at a time, starting with iterating through lines.

#### Iterating Through Lines with the `lines` Method

Rust has a helpful method to handle line-by-line iteration of strings,
conveniently named `lines`, that works as shown in Listing 12-17:

Filename: src/lib.rs

```
pub fn search<'a>(query: &str, contents: &'a str) -> Vec<&'a str> {
    for line in contents.lines() {
        // do something with line
    }
}
```

Listing 12-17: Iterating through each line in `contents`

The `lines` method returns an iterator. We’ll be talking about iterators in
depth in Chapter 13, but we’ve already seen this way of using an iterator in
Listing 3-6, where we used a `for` loop with an iterator to run some code on
each item in a collection.

#### Searching Each Line for the Query

Next, we’ll add functionality to check if the current line contains the query
string. Luckily, strings have another helpful method named `contains` that does
this for us! Add the `contains` method to the `search` function as shown in
Listing 12-18:

Filename: src/lib.rs

```
pub fn search<'a>(query: &str, contents: &'a str) -> Vec<&'a str> {
    for line in contents.lines() {
        if line.contains(query) {
            // do something with line
        }
    }
}
```

Listing 12-18: Adding functionality to see if the line contains the string in
`query`

#### Storing Matching Lines

Finally, we need a way to store the lines that contain our query string. For
that, we can make a mutable vector before the `for` loop and call the `push`
method to store a `line` in the vector. After the `for` loop, we return the
vector, as shown in Listing 12-19:

Filename: src/lib.rs

```
pub fn search<'a>(query: &str, contents: &'a str) -> Vec<&'a str> {
    let mut results = Vec::new();

    for line in contents.lines() {
        if line.contains(query) {
            results.push(line);
        }
    }

    results
}
```

Listing 12-19: Storing the lines that match so that we can return them

Now the `search` function should be returning only the lines that contain
`query`, and our test should pass. Let’s run the tests:

```
$ cargo test
running 1 test
test test::one_result ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured
```

Our test passed, great, it works!

Now that our test is passing, we could consider opportunities for refactoring
the implementation of the `search` function while keeping the code that passes
the tests, in order to maintain the same functionality. The code in the
`search` function isn’t too bad, but it isn’t taking advantage of some useful
features of iterators. We’ll be coming back to this example in Chapter 13 where
we’ll explore iterators in detail and see how to improve it.

#### Using the `search` Function in the `run` Function

Now that we have the `search` function working and tested, we need to actually
call `search` from our `run` function. We need to pass the `config.query` value
and the `contents` that `run` read from the file to the `search` function. Then
`run` will print out each line returned from `search`:

Filename: src/lib.rs

```
pub fn run(config: Config) -> Result<(), Box<Error>> {
    let mut f = File::open(config.filename)?;

    let mut contents = String::new();
    f.read_to_string(&mut contents)?;

    for line in search(&config.query, &contents) {
        println!("{}", line);
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

We’re still using a `for` loop to get each line returned from `search` and
printing out each line.

Now our whole program should be working! Let’s try it out, first with a word
that should return exactly one line from the Emily Dickinson poem, “frog”:

```
$ cargo run frog poem.txt
   Compiling minigrep v0.1.0 (file:///projects/minigrep)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.38 secs
     Running `target/debug/minigrep frog poem.txt`
How public, like a frog
```

Cool! Next, how about a word that will match multiple lines, like “the”:

```
$ cargo run the poem.txt
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.0 secs
     Running `target/debug/minigrep the poem.txt`
Then there’s a pair of us — don’t tell!
To tell your name the livelong day
```

And finally, let’s make sure that we don’t get any lines when we search for a
word that isn’t anywhere in the poem, like “monomorphization”:

```
$ cargo run monomorphization poem.txt
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.0 secs
     Running `target/debug/minigrep monomorphization poem.txt`
```

Excellent! We’ve built our own mini version of a classic tool, and learned a
lot about how to structure applications. We’ve also learned a bit about file
input and output, lifetimes, testing, and command line parsing.

To round out this project chapter, we’re going to briefly demonstrate how to
work with environment variables and how to print to standard error, both of
which are useful when writing command line programs. Feel free to move on to
Chapter 13 if you’d like at this point.

## Working with Environment Variables

We’re going to improve our tool with an extra feature: an option for case
insensitive searching that the user can turn on via an environment variable. We
could make this a command line option and require that users enter it each time
they want it to apply, but instead we’re going to use an environment variable.
This allows our users to set the environment variable once and have all their
searches be case insensitive in that terminal session.

### Writing a Failing Test for the Case-Insensitive `search` Function

We want to add a new `search_case_insensitive` function that we will call when
the environment variable is on.

We’re going to continue following the TDD process, so the first step is again
to write a failing test. We’ll add a new test for the new case-insensitive
search function, and rename our old test from `one_result` to `case_sensitive`
to be clearer about the differences between the two tests, as shown in Listing
12-20:

Filename: src/lib.rs

```
#[cfg(test)]
mod test {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn case_sensitive() {
        let query = "duct";
        let contents = "\
Rust:
safe, fast, productive.
Pick three.
Duct tape.";

        assert_eq!(
            vec!["safe, fast, productive."],
            search(query, contents)
        );
    }

    #[test]
    fn case_insensitive() {
        let query = "rUsT";
        let contents = "\
Rust:
safe, fast, productive.
Pick three.
Trust me.";

        assert_eq!(
            vec!["Rust:", "Trust me."],
            search_case_insensitive(query, contents)
        );
    }
}
```

Listing 12-20: Adding a new failing test for the case insensitive function
we’re about to add

Note that we’ve edited the old test’s `contents` too. We've added a new line
with the text “Duct tape”, with a capital D, that shouldn’t match the query
“duct” when we’re searching in a case sensitive manner. Changing the old test
in this way helps ensure that we don’t accidentally break the case sensitive
search functionality that we’ve already implemented; this test should pass now
and should continue to pass as we work on the case insensitive search.

The new test for the case *insensitive* search uses “rUsT” as its query. In the
`search_case_insensitive` function we’re going to add, the query “rUsT” should
match both the line containing “Rust:” with a capital R and also the line
“Trust me.” even though both of those have different casing than the query.
This is our failing test, and it will fail to compile because we haven’t yet
defined the `search_case_insensitive` function. Feel free to add a skeleton
implementation that always returns an empty vector in the same way that we did
for the `search` function in Listing 12-16 in order to see the test compile and
fail.

### Implementing the `search_case_insensitive` Function

The `search_case_insensitive` function, shown in Listing 12-21, will be almost
the same as the `search` function. The only difference is that we’ll lowercase
the `query` and each `line` so that whatever the case of the input arguments,
they will be the same case when we check whether the line contains the query.

Filename: src/lib.rs

```
fn search_case_insensitive<'a>(query: &str, contents: &'a str) -> Vec<&'a str> {
    let query = query.to_lowercase();
    let mut results = Vec::new();

    for line in contents.lines() {
        if line.to_lowercase().contains(&query) {
            results.push(line);
        }
    }

    results
}
```

Listing 12-21: Defining the `search_case_insensitive` function to lowercase
both the query and the line before comparing them

First, we lowercase the `query` string, and store it in a shadowed variable
with the same name. Calling `to_lowercase` on the query is necessary so that no
matter if the user’s query is “rust”, “RUST”, “Rust”, or “rUsT”, we’ll treat
the query as if it was “rust” and be insensitive to the case.

Note that `query` is now a `String` rather than a string slice, because calling
`to_lowercase` creates new data rather than referencing existing data. Say the
query is “rUsT”, as an example: that string slice does not contain a lowercase
“u” or “t” for us to use, so we have to allocate a new `String` containing
“rust”. When we pass `query` as an argument to the `contains` method now, we
need to add an ampersand because the signature of `contains` is defined to take
a string slice.

Next, we add a call to `to_lowercase` on each `line` before we check if it
contains `query` to lowercase all characters. Now that we’ve converted both
`line` and `query` to lowercase, we’ll find matches no matter what the case of
the query.

Let’s see if this implementation passes the tests:

```
running 2 tests
test test::case_insensitive ... ok
test test::case_sensitive ... ok

test result: ok. 2 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured
```

Great! Now, let’s actually call the new `search_case_insensitive` function from
the `run` function. First, we’re going to add a configuration option for
switching between case sensitive and case insensitive search to the `Config`
struct:

Filename: src/lib.rs

```
pub struct Config {
    pub query: String,
    pub filename: String,
    pub case_sensitive: bool,
}
```

We add the `case_sensitive` field that holds a boolean. Then we need our `run`
function to check the `case_sensitive` field’s value and use that to decide
whether to call the `search` function or the `search_case_insensitive` function
as shown in Listing 12-22:

Filename: src/lib.rs

```
pub fn run(config: Config) -> Result<(), Box<Error>>{
    let mut f = File::open(config.filename)?;

    let mut contents = String::new();
    f.read_to_string(&mut contents)?;

    let results = if config.case_sensitive {
        search(&config.query, &contents)
    } else {
        search_case_insensitive(&config.query, &contents)
    };

    for line in results {
        println!("{}", line);
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

Listing 12-22: Calling either `search` or `search_case_insensitive` based on
the value in `config.case_sensitive`

Finally, we need to actually check for the environment variable. The functions
for working with environment variables are in the `env` module in the standard
library, so we want to bring that module into scope with a `use std::env;` line
at the top of *src/lib.rs*. Then we’re going to use the `var` method from the
`env` module to check for an environment variable named `CASE_INSENSITIVE`, as
shown in Listing 12-23:

Filename: src/lib.rs

```
use std::env;

// ...snip...

impl Config {
    pub fn new(args: &[String]) -> Result<Config, &'static str> {
        if args.len() < 3 {
            return Err("not enough arguments");
        }

        let query = args[1].clone();
        let filename = args[2].clone();

        let case_sensitive = env::var("CASE_INSENSITIVE").is_err();

        Ok(Config { query, filename, case_sensitive })
    }
}
```

Listing 12-23: Checking for an environment variable named `CASE_INSENSITIVE`

Here, we create a new variable `case_sensitive`. In order to set its value, we
call the `env::var` function and pass it the name of the `CASE_INSENSITIVE`
environment variable. The `env::var` method returns a `Result` that will be the
successful `Ok` variant that contains the value of the environment variable if
the environment variable is set. It will return the `Err` variant if the
environment variable is not set.

We’re using the `is_err` method on the `Result` to check to see if it’s an
error, and therefore unset, which means it *should* do a case sensitive search.
If the `CASE_INSENSITIVE` environment variable is set to anything, `is_err`
will return false and it will perform a case insensitive search. We don’t care
about the *value* of the environment variable, just whether it’s set or unset,
so we’re checking `is_err` rather than `unwrap`, `expect`, or any of the other
methods we’ve seen on `Result`.

We pass the value in the `case_sensitive` variable to the `Config` instance so
that the `run` function can read that value and decide whether to call `search`
or `search_case_insensitive` as we implemented in Listing 12-22.

Let’s give it a try! First, we’ll run our program without the environment
variable set and with the query “to”, which should match any line that contains
the word “to” in all lowercase:

```
$ cargo run to poem.txt
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.0 secs
     Running `target/debug/minigrep to poem.txt`
Are you nobody, too?
How dreary to be somebody!
```

Looks like that still works! Now, let’s run the program with `CASE_INSENSITIVE`
set to 1 but with the same query “to”, and we should get lines that contain
“to” that might have uppercase letters:

```
$ CASE_INSENSITIVE=1 cargo run to poem.txt
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.0 secs
     Running `target/debug/minigrep to poem.txt`
Are you nobody, too?
How dreary to be somebody!
To tell your name the livelong day
To an admiring bog!
```

Excellent, we also got lines containing “To”! Our `minigrep` program can now do
case insensitive searching, controlled by an environment variable. Now you know
how to manage options set using either command line arguments or environment
variables!

Some programs allow both arguments *and* environment variables for the same
configuration. In those cases, the programs decide that one or the other takes
precedence. For another exercise on your own, try controlling case
insensitivity through a command line argument as well as through the
environment variable, and decide which should take precedence if the program is
run with contradictory values.

The `std::env` module contains many more useful features for dealing with
environment variables; check out its documentation to see what’s available.

## Writing Error Messages to `stderr` Instead of `stdout`

At the moment we’re writing all of our output to the terminal with the
`println!` function. Most terminals provide two kinds of output: *standard out*
for general information, and *standard error* for error messages. This
distinction enables users to choose whether to direct a the successful output
of a program to a file but still print error messages to the screen.

The `println!` function is only capable of printing to standard out, though, so
we have to use something else in order to print to standard error.

### Checking Where Errors are Written to

First, let’s observe how all content printed by `minigrep` is currently being
written to standard out, including error messages that we want to write to
standard error instead. We’ll do that by redirecting the standard output stream
to a file while we also intentionally cause an error. We won't redirect the
standard error stream, so any content sent to standard error will continue to
display on the screen.  Command line programs are expected to send error
messages to the standard error stream so that we can still see error messages
on the screen even if we choose to redirect the standard output stream to a
file. Our program is not currently well-behaved; we're about to see that it
saves the error message output to the file instead!

The way to demonstrate this behavior is by running the program with `>` and the
filename, *output.txt*, that we want to redirect the standard output stream to.
We're not going to pass any arguments, which should cause an error:

```
$ cargo run > output.txt
```

The `>` syntax tells the shell to write the contents of standard out to
*output.txt* instead of the screen. We didn’t see the error message we were
expecting printed on the screen, so that means it must have ended up in the
file. Let’s see what *output.txt* contains:

```
Problem parsing arguments: not enough arguments
```

Yup, our error message is being printed to standard out. It’s much more useful
for error messages like this to be printed to standard error, and have only
data from a successful run end up in the file when we redirect standard out in
this way. We’ll change that.

### Printing Errors to Standard Error

Let’s change how error messages are printed using the code in Listing 12-24.
Because of the refactoring we did earlier in this chapter, all the code that
prints error messages is in one function, in `main`. The standard library
provides the `eprintln!` macro that prints to the standard error stream, so
let's change the two places we were calling `println!` to print errors so that
these spots use `eprintln!` instead:

Filename: src/main.rs

```
fn main() {
    let args: Vec<String> = env::args().collect();

    let config = Config::new(&args).unwrap_or_else(|err| {
        eprintln!("Problem parsing arguments: {}", err);
        process::exit(1);
    });

    if let Err(e) = minigrep::run(config) {
        eprintln!("Application error: {}", e);

        process::exit(1);
    }
}
```

Listing 12-24: Writing error messages to `stderr` instead of `stdout` using
`eprintln!`

After changing `println!` to `eprintln!`, let’s try running the program again
in the same way, without any arguments and redirecting `stdout` with `>`:

```
$ cargo run > output.txt
Problem parsing arguments: not enough arguments
```

Now we see our error on the screen and `output.txt` contains nothing, which is
the behavior expected of command line programs.

If we run the program again with arguments that don’t cause an error, but still
redirect standard out to a file:

```
$ cargo run to poem.txt > output.txt
```

We won’t see any output to our terminal, and `output.txt` will contain our
results:

Filename: output.txt

```
Are you nobody, too?
How dreary to be somebody!
```

This demonstrates that we’re now using `stdout` for successful output and
`stderr` for error output as appropriate.

## Summary

In this chapter, we’ve recapped on some of the major concepts so far and
covered how to do common I/O operations in a Rust context. By using command
line arguments, files, environment variables, and the `eprintln!` macro with
`stderr`, you’re now prepared to write command line applications. By using the
concepts from previous chapters, your code will be well-organized, be able to
store data effectively in the appropriate data structures, handle errors
nicely, and be well tested.

Next, let’s explore some functional-language influenced Rust features: closures
and iterators.
