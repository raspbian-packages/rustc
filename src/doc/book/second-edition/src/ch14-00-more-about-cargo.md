# More about Cargo and Crates.io

So far we’ve used only the most basic features of Cargo to build, run, and test
our code, but it can do a lot more. Here we’ll go over some of its other, more
advanced features to show you how to:

* Customize your build through release profiles
* Publish libraries on crates.io
* Organize larger projects with workspaces
* Install binaries from crates.io
* Extend Cargo with your own custom commands

Cargo can do even more than what we can cover in this chapter too, so for a
full explanation, see [its documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/).
