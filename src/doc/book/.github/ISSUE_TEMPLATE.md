## What to expect when you file an issue here

Thank you for caring about the quality of the book! Each edition has
different types of issues we can accept, please read on for details.

### 2018 edition

This version of the book is under development, please file issues liberally!

### Second edition

For the second edition, we are currently working with No Starch Press to bring
it to print. Chapters go through a number of stages in the editing process, and
once they've gotten to the layout stage, they're effectively frozen.

For chapters that have gotten to the layout stage, we will likely only be
accepting changes that correct factual errors or major problems and not, for
example, minor wording changes.

Scroll all the way to the right on https://github.com/rust-lang/book/projects/1
to see which chapters have been frozen.

Please see CONTRIBUTING.md for more details.

### First edition

The first edition of the book is frozen, and bugs filed against it will
be closed.
