## What to expect when you file an issue here

### First edition

The first edition of the book is no longer being actively worked on.

Issues for the first edition of the book are worthwhile if you are planning to
submit a pull request, and want to discuss it first. But as we aren't actively
working on the first edition, general bugs will be closed.

### Second edition

For the second edition, we are currently working with No Starch Press to bring
it to print. Chapters go through a number of stages in the editing process, and
once they've gotten to the layout stage, they're effectively frozen.

For chapters that have gotten to the layout stage, we will likely only be
accepting changes that correct factual errors or major problems and not, for
example, minor wording changes.

Scroll all the way to the right on https://github.com/rust-lang/book/projects/1
to see which chapters have been frozen.

Please see CONTRIBUTING.md for more details.
