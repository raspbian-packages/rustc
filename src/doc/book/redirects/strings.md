% The Rust Programming Language Has Moved

When The Rust Programming Language only had one edition, it was all hosted at
`book/`. Now that it has two, they are properly namespaced under
`first-edition/` and `second-edition/`.

You've found this page because you have a link to the older URL structure; you
probably want to visit [first-edition/] if you need the exact older page; if
you're trying to learn Rust, checking out the [second edition] might be a
better choice.

[first-edition/]: first-edition/strings.html
[second edition]: second-edition/index.html
